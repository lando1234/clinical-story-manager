# TypeScript Types

This directory will contain shared TypeScript type definitions.

## Future Structure (TODO)

- `api.ts` - API request/response types
- `domain.ts` - Domain entity types
- `ui.ts` - UI-specific types

## Constraints

- Types should be colocated with their usage when possible
- Shared types go here
- Follow strict TypeScript conventions
